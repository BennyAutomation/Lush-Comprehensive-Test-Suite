# Comprehensive Selenium Test Suite *(Work In Progress)*

I've started work on a more thorough example of a testing suite for a single client.

I chose the Lush website as it is a fairly robust e-commerce site that will give me opportunity to test
features such as:
- Login/authentication
- Product-specific page navigation
- Wishlist/cart
- Payment/checkout system

This project uses Selenium, TestNG, and Maven for dependency management.
